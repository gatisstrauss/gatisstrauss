# Hi, everyone :wave:

### About me: <br>

My name is [Gatis Strauss](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gatisstrauss/) and I am a Software Developer. After many years of being a professional athlete, I decided to change my career and took my first intro course about programming. As the years have passed, I have spent most of my free time learning to code, for the past couple of months I have been doing it full-time. Right now learning, educating and progressing myself in the programming industry is my main goal.

### :boom: My project:   <br>

[A flight planner](https://github.com/gatisstrauss/flight-planner)

Since this is the begining of my programming career, all my focus has been based on learning and understaning how everything works. I have made my first project about a flight planner API backend with functionality to add, search and delete flights. I used Java and Spring Boot to build the project and to store the data in memory. Also made an option, using PostgresSQL, to store data in the database. Tested with Unit and Integration tests.
